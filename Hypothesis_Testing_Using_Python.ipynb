Although we may never know with 100% certainty, we can look for statistically significant differences between the sample statistics and the population paramters. This is done by first stating what is refered to as a null hypothesis, which in this scenario would be that there is no difference between the sample mean and the population mean. Then we look for statistical evidence to accept or reject the null hypothesis. What if we don't know the population parameters? \n",

    "Around 1900, a chemist and statistical wizard named William Sealy Gosset who went by the pen name Student worked for the Guiness Brewery in Ireland. in his mission to use science to make better beer, he noticed that in situations where the population __standard deviation is unknown (most situations)__, it can be estimated using the sample standard deviation (using the unbiased version normalized by N-1). But, if the __sample size is small (let's say less than 30 is small)__ the shape of the distribution of sample means has thicker tails than a normal distribution because there is more variability in the estimate of the standard deviation of the sample mean (the standard error), which itself depends on the sample size. Thus, the z-test is unreliable because z-values are determend using a normal distribuiton. Instead, we must draw our test statistic from a different distribution called the t-distribution. The shape of this distribution narrows and becomes more normal like and the sample size increases or degrees of freedom increases, where degrees of freedom is N-1. Thus, Student's t-test is conducted in a fashion similar to a z-test but the t-statistic is pulled from a different distribution and thus a different table. The t-statistic itself has a similar form to the z-statistic in that it is a ration of a deviation divided by a measure of variability. However, the exact for of the ratio for the t-statistic depends on the nature of the data being used. Next I'll show you how to apply Student's t-test to various experimental scenarios.\n",
